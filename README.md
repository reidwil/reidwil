### Hi my name is Reid ðŸ‘‹

### About me :receipt:
- I got married during covid to my college sweetheart
- I recently became a cat person ðŸ˜º
- I currently live in Brooklyn, New York :city_sunset:
- I'm ambidexterous
- I'm an autodidactic programmer (minus one or two excellent mentors)
- I believe one of the sweetest joys in life is learning
- I've played ultimate frisbee since 2010 - 3 of those years at the national collegiate level :flying_disc:

### Sayings I live by
- A rolling rock gathers no moss.
- Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.
- You gotta move with the movers, man.
- Great leaders are not always in front, they also know who to follow.
- I have a lot of proof that the world is conspiring to make me happy.
